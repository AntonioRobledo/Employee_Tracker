# Employee Tracker

## Description

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. This is a command-line application that manages a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## User Story

```md
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```

## Acceptance Criteria

## Installation

To install this command-line application, you'll need to install dependencies for Inquirer, MySql, and Console Table. You can install each of these by running npm i @ inquirer 8.2.4, and npm console.table, and by installling the up-to-date driver for MySql that can be found through this link: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/. After inquiring each of these, you'll need to make sure to import them into an index.js file to be able to use them in the command line. 

## Usage 

To make use of the database in MySql, you'll need to navigate into the db file and run mysql -u root -p and enter the password you have created for MySql. Next, you'll need to source the schema.sql file in order to create the database and source the seeds.sql file in order to prepopulate the database with employee information. Make sure to run 'use employee_db' to utilize the tables within the database. After exiting out of the MySql shell, navigate back to the index.js file and open it in either an integrated terminal or in your machine's native terminal. Finally, run the command "node index.js" in order to start the Employee Tracker application.
